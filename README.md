# NOTE: Very old with shockingly terrible code
I made this so long ago. it ust has if statements and is an interpreter inside of an interpreter.
So its solow, bad, and has basically zero useful features. like not even varibles exist :(
And no why would I ever work on this
# Jam
Jam is a very simple interpreted programming language made using python.
# downloading and using
Start off by installing python 3.x and then download the zip for the code. In the same directory create a file named "main.jm". you can put the code here. when you have made your code, run the python file by double clicking on it.
# syntax
functions are ran by typing them in capital letters, and then using the ":" sign.
# input and output commands
There are many input and output commands, here they are:
## PRINT
PRINT prints text onto the screen, and is used in the following way:

`PRINT: your text here`
## INPUT
INPUT allows the user to type text onto the screen. It is used in the following way:

`INPUT: your prompt here`
## SAVEINPUT
SAVEINPUT does the same as input, but it doesnt use a prompt and can be saved into a variable. It is used in the following way:

`SAVEINPUT: your variable name here`
## PRINTSAVE
PRINTSAVE allows you to print variables that have been created. it is used in the following way:

`PRINTSAVE: variable to print here`

this language is in alpha, so changes are expected all the time.

loops
if statements
